Hey there ğŸ‘‹,
Skander here.
This year has been a whirlwind for climate. So letâ€™s take some time this year to answer the big questions:
What is the impact of climate change so far?
The costs, the consequences, and the urgency weâ€™re facing.
What are the big narratives?
From AIâ€™s energy footprint to Chinaâ€™s dominance, and the impact of the funding ice age.
What will happen in 2025?
Emerging trends, political headwinds, and the next big bets.
Weâ€™ll explore whatâ€™s going wellâ€”breakthroughs in solar, EVs, and batteriesâ€”and whatâ€™s not moving forward: the AI energy crunch, the funding freeze, and political roadblocks. Together, letâ€™s dissect 2024 to understand how the climate story is evolvingâ€”and where itâ€™s heading next.
In the past year, Climate Drift has become a space for exploring solutions and helping people break into climate. Weâ€™ve run 3 cohorts of our career accelerator, thousands of founders, investors, and professionals have dove into our analysis and we were lucky to connect founders, investors, and professionals.
Itâ€™s a community learning how to scale what worksâ€”and what comes next.
We wouldnâ€™t be where we are without their help.
A huge thanks goes to
