==============================

Hey everyone!
We have been working hard behind the scenes.
Next to working together with top climate funds and research institutions (more on that soon), we also spent 80+ hours giving free 1on1 climate career mentor sessions to some 300+ people on our waiting list while having 100+ people sign up for our first climate career transition workshop.
We realized two things: calls are hard to scale and a 1-day workshop is not nearly enough to create the tsunami-type talent wave we need to break into the climate economy.
While many people are already self-educating, taking courses, and earning advanced degrees, they still find it incredibly challenging to transition in climate.
It is time for something new:

üåä Why we do it
The motivation behind this is clear:
Talented professionals often struggle to enter the climate industry, while climate companies find it challenging to recruit top talent.
Our accelerator is designed to bridge this gap, creating a pathway for exceptional candidates to launch and accelerate their climate careers.
ü§ù Building with you
This is our first cohort. We believe we've pinpointed the challenges in bringing people into the climate sector and are currently introducing the first 100 individuals.
This builds on Marco's previous success in guiding thousands into the tech industry.
But the climate challenge is new, and we will need to find more and better ways to help people shift into climate.
