Hey there üëã
Skander, here!
We are continuing our deep dive into companies attending
The Drop conference
in Sweden next week.
Buildings significantly contribute to global carbon emissions through various phases of their lifecycle. The production and transportation of building materials, especially concrete and steel, emit substantial CO2. Insulation plays a pivotal role in energy conservation, with inadequate insulation leading to increased energy use for heating and cooling. Energy control, through smart systems and designs, can optimize power consumption, mitigating emissions from electricity sources. Traditional heating methods, often reliant on fossil fuels, further amplify emissions.
Till next week we aim to explore startups across nine sectors: from
Transportation yesterday
, to Buildings today, to Power, Circular Economy, Food & Agriculture, Industry, Finance, Software and Carbon Removal.
In Part 1 we shine a light on Transportation

Let‚Äôs dive in üåä
Let‚Äôs first dive into the emissions connected to buildings
From the great
State of Climate Action
Buildings and their associated systems are responsible for nearly 40% of global carbon dioxide  emissions when both operational and embodied emissions are considered:
Building Materials:
Concrete and steel are particularly carbon-intensive. For instance, cement (a key component of concrete) production accounts for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions.
Insulation:
Proper insulation can significantly reduce a building's energy demand. In the U.S., for instance, heating and cooling account for about 48% of the energy use in a typical home, making it the largest energy expense. Improving insulation can thus have a notable impact on this figure.
Energy Control:
Buildings with smart systems and better design can use up to 50% less energy than buildings designed without energy efficiency in mind.
Heating:
In the EU, heating and hot water alone account for around 79% of total final energy use in households. This is significant, especially when fossil fuels are the primary energy source.
Let's explore the solutions these startups have introduced.
BlueHeart Energy
Blue Heart Energy is currently developing the first heat pump for residential use based on a Thermo Acoustic (TA) heat engine, a toxic-free, flexible and highly efficient solution.
