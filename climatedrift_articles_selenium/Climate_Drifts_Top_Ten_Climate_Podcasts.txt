The "electricity gauntlet" has garnered national attention with discussions on rising electricity demand due to new loads like electric vehicles (EVs) and data centers, versus a slow-growing supply plagued by interconnection delays and construction challenges. This imbalance, accentuated by the AI race driving tech giants to increase power for their data centers, has utilities struggling to meet demand, which could lead to extended reliance on natural gas and coal. In this episode, Shayle talks with Andy Lubershane about potential solutions such as nuclear, grid-enhancing technologies, and geothermal, exploring how these could satisfy load growth more sustainably and the impact on electricity prices and emissions.
