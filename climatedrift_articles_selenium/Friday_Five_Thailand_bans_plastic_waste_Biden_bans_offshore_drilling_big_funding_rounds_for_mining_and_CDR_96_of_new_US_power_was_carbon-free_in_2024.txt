Hey there 👋
Skander here.
Happy (belated) New Year!
In case you didn’t have a chance yet: our 160 slide Climate Recap 2024 is diving into the big questions of the last and this year:
🌍 What’s the impact of climate change? The costs, the consequences, and the urgency we’re facing.
📊 What are the big narratives? From AI’s energy footprint to China’s dominance and the climate tech funding ice age.
🔮 What’s coming in 2025? Emerging trends, political roadblocks, and the next big opportunities.

We’ve also got big plans for the year ahead:
- More
Climate Drift accelerator
& more for
our community
- Open fireside chats with leading builders in batteries, FOAK, and more.
- Podcasts (maybe even two!)
- 2-3 secret projects that we are working on with drifties
For now, here are the five stories I found most important this week with some (needed) context.
🌊 Let’s dive in
The 4th cohort of our accelerator is starting mid February and applications are still open (and a few spots are left). We are already interviewing and selecting participants, so apply now and make an impact:

Thailand bans imports of plastic waste to curb toxic pollution
Developing countries are tired of being the world’s dumping ground. Thailand’s move is another wake-up call to nations that have outsourced their waste problem for too long. This is not the first country that does it (most famously
China
), and won’t be the last.
If international treaties are failing, as we have seen
last December with the UN plastic talks,
this will be the next step and progress we make.

Biden permanently bans offshore drilling in 625 million acres of ocean, making a Trump reversal difficult
This move locks in a significant portion of the US coastal ecosystem, ensuring long-term protection against fossil fuel expansion. Hopefully a tangible step forward in securing energy transition momentum. It also reminds me of the chatter I heard over the last few months from DC on locking in transition momentum through allocated and wired IRA subsidies.

And as a general reminder:
Sustainability by numbers
The low-carbon energy transition will need less mining than fossil fuels, even when adjusted for waste rock
Back in January, I published a post looking at the amount of minerals that were required for the low-carbon energy transition. This came from projections in the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions…

Chart: 96 percent of new US power capacity was carbon-free in 2024
Renewables dominate the capacity scoreboard yet again. The US grid transition is picking up pace, but the challenge remains in integrating this new capacity effectively. Cue my favorite
