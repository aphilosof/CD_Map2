==============================

The climate tech landscape is vast.
Itâ€™s easy to get lost.
It happened to meâ€¦and hundreds of people trying to switch into climate.
Whatâ€™s the
best way to stop getting lost
?
You
get a map and start using it
.
We put every relevant field on our simple
Climate Solutions Map
.
Nothing fancy (for now), but a simple place to see all the different sub-sectors that help fight climate change.
The map breaks down every climate area.
Think:
â†’ Transportation
â†’ Buildings
â†’ Industry
â†’ Power
â†’ etcâ€¦
We hope this first version is already helpful to you.
In
future versions
weâ€™ll drill down into:
> Job trends ðŸ“ˆ
> Funding rounds ðŸ’°,
> Leading companies ðŸ’¼,
> Progress of each climate sector.
You can
download the latest version
from my friend Skander
here
