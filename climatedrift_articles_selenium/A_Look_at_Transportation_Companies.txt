Hey there üëã
Skander, here!
Next week,
The Drop conference
in Sweden will be the hotspot for every top European VC, investor, and climate tech company.
Climate Drift got invited to be at The Drop, ensuring you get firsthand insights and takeaways.
Leading up to the event, we'll be highlighting the diverse range of companies set to attend The Drop.
These startups span 9 sectors: from Power to Buildings, Circular Economy, Food & Agriculture, Industry, Finance, and Carbon Removal.
In Part 1 we shine a light on Transportation

Kicking things off today, let's delve into the
transportation companies
making an appearance:
The companies attending in our Climate Solutions map
But first, let‚Äôs look at the impact of Transportation on emissions
From the great
State of Climate Action
Transportation contributes to nearly 9% of global carbon emissions.
Thankfully we are already working on many solutions: Micro-mobility can reduce city transport emissions by up to 30% in urban settings. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has the potential to cut aviation CO2 emissions by 80% over their full lifecycle. The maritime sector, responsible for about 2-3% of global emissions, sees potential in alternative fuels like ammonia, which can reduce ship emissions by 99%. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can capture up to 90% of the CO2 emissions produced. Electric Vehicles (EVs) on a renewable energy grid can result in 70% fewer emissions than gasoline cars. Electrifying fleets can potentially replace millions of polluting vehicles, while hydrogen trucks offer near-zero emissions, with hydrogen production from green sources being key.
Let‚Äôs see which solutions are attending The Drop.

Maersk
Maersk, the Danish titan of maritime trade, has long dominated global container shipping. Established in 1904, its vast fleet has become emblematic of globalization's ebb and flow. Yet, the digital age beckons, and Maersk is navigating treacherous waters of technological disruption and environmental scrutiny. Its recent forays into blockchain and sustainable fuels underscore a strategic pivot towards innovation. Amid geopolitical tensions and supply chain conundrums, Maersk's ability to recalibrate its compass is telling. The company boasts a workforce of approximately 110,000 employees, spanning operations in 130 countries.

Toyota
Founded in 1937, Toyota has evolved from a humble loom-making enterprise into a global automotive juggernaut. The Japanese firm's commitment to innovation, epitomized by its pioneering hybrid technology, has solidified its position as an industry leader. Yet, in an era of electric zeal, Toyota faces challenges from nimble upstarts and established rivals alike. Its ethos of 'kaizen' or continuous improvement, however, suggests adaptability. While navigating geopolitical trade spats and supply chain disruptions, Toyota's blend of tradition and tenacity offers a masterclass in resilience.
