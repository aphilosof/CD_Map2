Hey there! üëã
Skander & Marco here.
Climate Drift has come a long way since we published
our solutions map
.
In a year, Climate Drift has become a go-to resource for climate solutions and how to break into climate:
Thousands of leading Climate investors and founders
from organizations like Breakthrough Energy, Elemental Excelerator, and RMI are diving deep into our climate solutions analyses.
We've successfully run 2 cohorts of our Climate Drift Career Accelerator
, helping experienced professionals land leadership roles in climate companies.
Our alumni are now working on Rewiring America, electrifying homes and businesses, finding solutions to cow burps, developing heavy duty cargo bikes‚Äò for last mile deliveries, helping build out the nascent SAF industry and many more
We've hosted over 50 speakers from climate companies and investors who share their behind-the-scenes knowledge, networks, and intel with our Climate Drift members.
Time to take stock, review where we are and share where we are headed.
üåäLet's dive in
You are reading this because you like our deep dives.
While originally researched and written by yours truly, it's now increasingly powered by our community of Climate Drifties - experienced professionals who join us through the Climate Drift Career Accelerator program.
In the last month we dove into:
Recycled Aluminum: Miracle or Myth
with Matt
Distributed Energy Resources (DER)
with Maura
Checklist for First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) Funding

And many more.
There is a lot more coming, we are tackling topics from
How to get more young people into Farming
to
Incentivizing Geostorage
to
The climate impact of AI
.
All coming from Climate Drifties who just graduated from our accelerator.

On to the regularly scheduled program.
The Climate Drift Career Accelerator:
Bringing the best talent into climate
So what is the accelerator?
Our 8-week Climate Drift Career Accelerator is
designed for mid-career professionals
ready to move into the climate economy.
Climate Drift members gain an overview of impactful climate solutions, identify areas they're passionate about, and
apply their skills to solve real problems that leading climate companies and investors share directly with us
- some of which we publish as deep dives on Climate Drift.
Veteran teachers call this:
üëâ Hands-on Education + Real-world Learning
Were you constantly apply your skills to a challenge. Trying to figure out what works. How things could be done better. All on something real (not a theoretical group project).

Announcement #2: New Website!
We‚Äôve built a new site that dives into everything you need to know about our accelerator program. Check it out

On Community
We design our community
and each cohort
for a single goal
:
üëâ
Everyone you meet inside Climate Drift is worth talking to
.
Our members are leaders from across tech, education, finance, and non-profits, giving you the chance to engage with senior executives who bring a wealth of experience and diverse perspectives to the table.
They have held leadership positions at tech giants (Apple, Spotify, Google, Amazon, etc.) and been early employees at household startups like Shopify, Solugen & Wealthfront.
They've managed teams ranging from a dozen to hundreds, overseen billion-dollar product lines, led mergers and acquisitions, and helped take companies public.
Some have already left their mark on climate: Building robots to harvest lettuce in the biggest vertical farms in North America, spending a decade at public utilities deploying $300M+ into fleet electrification or designing the ebike you love.
Whoever you meet in the Climate Drift Community, you will be as impressed as we are.
How do we make this happen?
We curate our community intentionally through a rigorous interview process.
Because the climate economy needs experienced professionals who can execute, scale companies to the next level, and bring new climate solutions to market.
How does the accelerator work?
As we shared
in our last update
:
The program addresses four main challenges of professionals wanting to break into climate:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Lack of network in the climate sector
2Ô∏è‚É£ Overwhelming number of climate solutions
3Ô∏è‚É£ Absence of direct climate experience
4Ô∏è‚É£ Limited job transition experience.
Our current program is designed for execution and action:
Which is why we front load the baseline learnings before the accelerator starts (in Week 0) by sharing initial prep material to read/listen/watch.
We also invite all participants to book a 1-1 mentor call with Skander to dive into areas they‚Äôd like to focus on, giving them specific resources to get started the right way.
And then it‚Äôs off to the races:
Each week we are covering a different topic:
And during the week we are diving deep, every day:
The Climate Drift accelerator would be nothing without our speakers.
Each week, we host two firesides: an investor and an operator
, who share their experiences and current challenges.
Here are a handful of the leading professionals who have joined our last two cohorts and
shared their inside knowledge, access to their network, and understanding of ‚Äúwhat needs doing today‚Äù

But Does It Actually Work?
Our last cohort of 60+ senior professionals gave us an
NPS score of 64
(that‚Äôs higher than Apple) and a satisfaction rating of
4.6 out of 6 stars
.
They left us reviews like the below:
"This is truly
like no other cohort out there
! The intimate community setting and amazing, intelligent speakers are unmatched. And
I‚Äôve tried several other programs before
."
"I've gotten
tremendous value
out of the course; specifically the
action-oriented nature
of the course (
learning + doing, not just learning
) and the orientation towards landing a career in climate and HOW to do it"
"I learned SO MUCH and
feel 10x more equipped for my climate career goals than before
."
If you are a mid-career professional thinking about moving into climate and working on the most pressing issue of our generation.
Then apply for the Climate Drift Career Accelerator.
We built it precisely for people like you.
