Hi there! 👋
Skander here.
Today we are tackling something fascinating that has been the talk of the Carbon Removal Town for a while - Biochar.
But what is it? ”Biochar is a carbon-rich residue derived from the pyrolysis of biomass and stands at the intersection of sustainability, agriculture, and environmental stewardship.” - at least this is what the first definition that Wikipedia gives us.
Time for a deep dive!

In Part 1, Eirik dives into the 'Production, Properties, and Uses' of biochar.
For the first time on Climate Drift, he's delivering the deep dive via slides—think high-density, info-packed slides that are as enlightening as they are entertaining.
