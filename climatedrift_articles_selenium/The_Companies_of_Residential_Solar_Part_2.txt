The companies of Residential Solar
Part 2: Here come the Challengers
Today's companies employ three distinct strategies, and we will be analyzing them based on their size and strategic approaches.
Palmetto
Employees 255
HQ: Charleston, South Carolina based
Established  2010
For Chris Kemper, the founder and CEO of Palmetto, the customer has always been the beacon. He sees the North Star of his vision defined by two pivotal factors: cost and experience.
Trust in a Fragmented Solar Terrain:
Amidst the solar sector's vast, decentralized landscape brimming with myriad local contenders, carving a trustworthy brand is no easy feat. Yet, Palmetto illuminates the scene with gleaming 4.9 stars on Google reviews.
Evolutionary Business Model:
Having spent years as a traditional vertical seller, Palmetto has transformed its role. They now serve as the central conduit, bridging homeowners, installers, outsourced sales and marketing teams, services, financiers, and equipment manufacturers.
This pivot has empowered them to:
Slash operational expenditures - by lowering soft costs (primarily labor) across the value chain
Amplify profit margins - by letting each stakeholder focus on what they are best
Resulting in surplus cash channeled towards research, development, and automation.
Market Strategy - following the ecommerce playbook:
Shifting gears from conventional salesforce tactics, Palmetto is now harnessing the e-commerce playbook - digital first, direct-to-consumer.  They aim to make purchasing solar for your home as simple as shopping on Amazon.
They're also forging alliances with utility providers and mortgage corporations - going where already strong (energy based) customer relationships exist.
Kemperâ€™s Outlook:
In his forecast, Chris predicts a potential implosion for traditional vertical companies. Reflecting on the last decade, he reckons that Palmetto's current model would've been implausible then.
Financial Fusion:
Teaming up with mortgage entities, they advocate that solar considerations should top mortgage priorities.
Service for everyone:
Palmetto reaches out to "orphaned" solar clients â€“ individuals left unsupported after a single solar venture or those who purchased from now defunct solar companies. In search of a dependable ally for solar maintenance and optimization, these clients present potential upsell opportunities, such as battery installations and more.
Installation Innovation:
In their approach to outsourcing installations, Palmetto draws inspiration from staffing strategies of tech giants like Uber and Lyft. Through cohort analyses, they not only retain top talent but also incentivize their best workers for continued excellence.
E-commerce Excellence & Feedback:
Every Google review isnâ€™t just a metric; it's a lesson. They diligently respond, absorb feedback, and refine their operational matrix.
ION Solar
Employees 1300
HQ: Provo, Utah
Private company
Established 2013
Meet Ion Solar: not just another solar company but an embodiment of true-blue, American craftsmanship in the sun-powered domain.
What Sets Ion Apart?
Focus on Direct Sales (door to door), selling only american products (at a premium), starting at lesser known states, and then expanding from there (everyone needs solar, even if the winter is harsh).
Integrated Solar Solutions:
Ion Solar champions a unified service approach. They also believe in a strong customer relationship, with high reviews.
Technological Emphasis:
Ion's unified software platform offers an integrated interface for every phase of the buyer's journey and for each stakeholder. Beyond simplifying operations, this comprehensive digital solution is designed to foster deeper customer engagement and streamline the entire process.
Salesforce Prowess:
For Ion's in-house sales team, efficiency is a practiced principle, not merely rhetoric. Emphasizing door-to-door engagement, they consistently achieve remarkable retention rates and swift conversions, complemented seamlessly by expedited installation procedures.
Commitment to Local Craftsmanship:
Ion Solarâ€™s allegiance to North American manufacturing stands out. With an unwavering commitment to use 100% locally-made equipment, Ion champions not just quality but also the American spirit.
Industry Standing:
By January 2022, Ion Solar distinguished itself as the 8th leading residential installer in the US. Intriguingly, their journey didn't begin in the traditionally sought-after solar markets like sunny California, but in the snow-clad terrains of Utah. This strategic choice to initiate in more challenging markets has refined their approach, providing them with a distinct competitive edge.
Pineapple Energy
Employees: 8
HQ: Minnetonka, Minnesota
Public company
Established 2020
In 2020, the solar industry saw the inception of a promising enterprise: Pineapple Energy. Founded by Kyle J. Udseth, the company's formation wasn't a shot in the dark. Udseth, carrying with him executive-level experiences from solar titans like Sungevity, Sunnova, and Sunrun since 2015, brings a reservoir of industry knowledge to Pineapple Energy.
Core Belief: Stronger together
At the heart of Udseth's enterprise lies a belief: Residential solar is undergoing a fundamental transformation, metamorphosing into what can be likened to a banking domain. With this understanding, how does Pineapple Energy intend to navigate the solar landscape?
Strategic Approach
Pineapple Energy's strategy is layered yet straightforward:
Identification and Acquisition:
Recognize leading players in solar, storage, and energy services, then integrate them under the Pineapple banner.
Operational Autonomy:
Once acquired, these mid-sized installers are not overhauled. Instead, they are trusted to function efficiently, employing their industry practices.
Shared Resources and Synergy:
Acquired entities gain access to a suite of shared services, spanning HR, marketing, regulatory concerns, technological support, and legal aid. Furthermore, Pineapple's umbrella promises cost synergies, encompassing aspects like equipment procurement and favorable financing conditions.
Why Opt for Established Brands?
One might wonder about Pineapple's acquisition preferences. The answer leans towards legacy. Older, established brands bring with them:
National Recognition:
An assurance of credibility and trust.
Database Potential:
A backlog of unsold leads, ready to be redirected and optimized.
Expansive Base:
A platform ripe for referrals, upselling, and cross-selling ventures.
In Summary: Acquisition works
With six acquisitions and counting, Pineapple Energy emerges as a tactful player in the solar realm. By melding the best of old-school brand reliability with modern operational efficiency, Udseth's venture promises to be a beacon of strategic innovation in the ever-evolving world of solar energy.
