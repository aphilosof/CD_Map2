The microgrid and distributed energy market in the U.S. is experiencing rapid changes, driven by both demand and supply-side dynamics.
On the demand side:
Factors such as increased weather events, grid interconnectivity issues, and localized power demand from facilities like data centers are pushing for more resilient and adaptable energy solutions.
Trends towards the decentralization of energy, coupled with growing corporate commitments to sustainability and Net Zero targets, are amplifying the demand for clean, reliable energy sources.
On the supply side:
Recent legislative changes and technological advancements, particularly in energy storage, have catalyzed the commercialization of microgrids.
These developments have made microgrids increasingly economically viable, positioning them as a key solution to the challenges faced by the energy sector and customers seeking resilient energy solutions.
As we delve deeper into the changing market dynamics, it becomes evident that
microgrids are at the cusp of a significant commercialization opportunity in the U.S.
, poised to play a pivotal role in the evolving energy landscape
Market-shaping Policy
Recent policies like CA Senate Bill 1339 and FERC Order 2222 have effectively shaped the path for microgrid commercialization by streamlining interconnection processes, ensuring fair compensation, and allowing diverse aggregations of distributed energy resources to participate in energy markets.
CA Senate Bill 1339 (SB 1339)
: Signed into law in 2018, SB 1339 directs the California Public Utilities Commission to
develop rules and regulations to support the commercialization of microgrids
, focusing on streamlining interconnection processes and ensuring fair compensation for services provided by microgrids [
11]
.
Impact:
California‚Äôs passage of SB 1339 was a huge step towards creating a market for the commercialization of microgrids, as it helps address interconnection issues and facilitates the integration of microgrids into the California energy market.
FERC Order 2222
: Issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commision in 2020, this
watershed order
requires wholesale energy markets to allow aggregations of distributed energy resources (DERs) to participate
, defining DERs as a class of resource with the right to market participation [
12
].
Impact:
One of the key implications was that it allowed for ‚Äúheterogeneous aggregations‚Äù of energy resources to participate (i.e. not just one group of resources like batteries ‚Äì you could now have solar + batteries, etc.). This means that microgrid operators could transmit (sell) energy back into the grid, unlocking commercial potential.
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA):
Enacted in 2022, the IRA is the largest federal investment ($369 billion) in decarbonizing and modernizing the power sector in history. The IRA supports the adoption of various DERs through direct financial incentives and rebates, aligning with FERC Order 2222 to accelerate the adoption of clean energy technologies [
13
].
Impact:
If the investments of the IRA are fully realized, it could catalyze a paradigm shift in the U.S. energy landscape, propelling demand response programs and distributed energy resources like microgrids, from niche to mainstream.
These policies collectively create a conducive environment for the integration of microgrids into the energy market. They address key barriers to commercialization, such as interconnection challenges and economic viability, paving the way for adoption and growth.
Technological Advancements
Continuous advancements in microgrid technologies, energy storage, and smart grid solutions present opportunities for microgrid providers to offer more efficient and cost-effective systems. Because microgrids are essentially a modular system of interconnected component parts, technological advancements can quickly drive unit economics down the curve, creating a clear path to increased value as you commercialize and scale.
Development in four key components is really contributing to the commercial viability and growth of Microgrids:
Behind-the-Meter Solar:
Accessible and economical PV solar arrays (rooftop, ground mount, carport, etc.)
Storage:
Advancements in battery storage, coupled with falling battery costs, are currently the most significant technological drivers in the microgrid and distributed energy sector
. The economic viability of battery storage has unlocked new possibilities for microgrids, enhancing their feasibility and encouraging greater participation in the grid.

Switchgears:
One of the important components of a microgrid, a
switchgear
is the ‚Äúnerve center‚Äù of a microgrid or distributed energy system. It‚Äôs the component that allows your system to produce, store, dispatch, and utilize energy in the optimal way when you have multiple inputs.
Advancements in switchgear technology have enhanced the efficiency and reliability of microgrids, enabling more precise control and management of energy flows.
Additionally, modern switchgears are increasingly incorporating data analytics capabilities, allowing microgrid operators to monitor and optimize performance in real-time. This not only improves the operational efficiency of microgrids, but it also opens up potential revenue streams for microgrid operators through the integration of p
roprietary
software layers that offer advanced energy management solutions
.

Dispatchable Generation Assets:
Usually a generator that can be run on fuels (diesel, natural gas, propane). Newer ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù fuel sources like Hydrogen or biofuels offer more renewable alternatives to fossil fuel generation.
Innovative Financing Models (EAAS
)
One of the main drivers of microgrid commercialization is the innovation of the financing mechanisms: Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) or Microgrids-as-a-Service (MaaS) models
.
Microgrids are multi-million dollar projects and the capital expenditures required to develop a microgrid can be prohibitive to customer adoption and deployment. The
Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS)
model removes this cost barrier and allows organizations to deploy microgrids without any upfront capital investment
.
In a MaaS arrangement, a third-party provider typically covers the upfront capital for the design, installation, and operation of a microgrid. Customers then pay for the energy they consume, similar to a traditional utility bill, but with the added advantages of enhanced reliability, improved power quality, and potentially lower energy costs.
These agreements are often structured like modified
Power Purchase Agreements
(PPAs), where the MaaS provider not only supplies the hardware and software, but also arranges the financing and operation & maintenance agreements.
This turnkey solution addresses several critical concerns for customer facilities, including:
24/7 resilient power for critical services
Infrastructure modernization costs
Predictable and hedged energy costs over long periods
Reduced energy costs by monetizing equity tax incentives for governmental and non-profit organizations.
Additionally, for interconnected microgrids that are selling energy back into the main utility grid,
this model can even result in cost savings for the customer‚Äã‚Äã over the lifespan of a 20-year contract term.
To put this into context, let‚Äôs look at a cost comparison between a Microgrid-as-a-Service agreement vs. a typical diesel backup generator for a large footprint grocery store in California:
Microgrid vs. Cost comparison for a large footprint grocery store in Southern California
[Source:
Scale Microgrids Quote Calculator
]
Clearly, a Microgrid-as-a-Service (MaaS) agreement offers significant financial advantages over a typical diesel backup generator. With a MaaS agreement, there is no capital cost or ongoing maintenance cost for the customer, and the microgrid services fee is offset by substantial utility bill savings.
By removing the complexity and financial risk, while also providing operational savings, EaaS and MaaS models have significantly accelerated the commercialization and accessibility of microgrids.
Improved Economics
As a result of these legislative and technological advancements, combined with the Energy-as-a-Service models, the economic viability of ‚Äúislanding‚Äù microgrids has dramatically improved over the past few years. Microgrids are now a much more cost-effective and viable solution for energy resilience.
Recent figures suggest that commercial-scale microgrids are now available in the range of a 25% - 30% price premium to a non-islandable storage system like solar + storage. When considering the value of islanding capabilities and resilience, microgrids offer a much more cost-competitive solution.
Trends toward Standardization
As a combination of assets, the inherent modularity of microgrids makes it easier to expand or adjust the system based on changing energy needs, making them a versatile option for future-proofing energy systems.
Microgrids tend to be highly customizable, which contributes to longer time to market. Microgrids can also introduce complexity into the power distribution equation.
Standardizing microgrid design and implementation can
mitigate these challenges and
accelerate much needed adoption.
Projected Market Growth and Commercialization Opportunity
The microgrid market has experienced substantial growth and evolution in recent years, driven by a convergence of technological advancements, energy resilience concerns, improved economics and a shifting energy landscape.

De-risked business model and solutions offerings
Effective customer segmentation & targeting approach
Technology differentiators
Key strategic partnerships
Comprehensive microgrids solutions bundle & competitive pricing model
Operational excellence & Sales effectiveness
In the following section, we will explore these considerations for microgrid developers.
Market Risks & Opportunities
In developing a go-to-market strategy, it's important to consider both market risks/opportunities and execution risks/opportunities.
The following section and table below highlights several of these key considerations for the commercialization of microgrids.
Market R&O:
Utilities
(Opportunity and Risk)
‚Äì
Utilities are one of the single most important stakeholders in the energy transition and will play a significant part in the expansion of Microgrids.
Opportunity
: One one hand, utilities are exploring the role of microgrids as a grid infrastructure and operational resource, making them a potential customer for Microgrids providers.
Risk:
On the other hand, the decentralization of energy and the ability for Microgrids to operate independent of the main utilities grids may create a dynamic where utilities see Microgrids as a competitor.
Policy and Regulatory Changes
(Opportunity and Risk)
‚Äì Future changes in energy policies and regulations can either create opportunities for microgrid deployment or impose constraints that hinder market penetration.
Opportunity:
The creation of policies that advance the development of distributed energy resources ‚Äì and Microgrids specifically ‚Äì can be a commercial enabler
(ex:
FERC 2222,
CA SB 1339
and the
IRA
).
To date,
13 states have adopted policies, programs or initiatives to enable the use of Microgrids to improve resilience during grid outages
[
22
]. Some states, such as California, Colorado and Oregon have also introduced resilience funding projects that include provisions for expanding microgrids.
Risk:
The development and deployment of microgrids can be hindered by complex and inconsistent regulatory frameworks. Utility regulations, interconnection standards, and permitting processes may not always be conducive to the integration of microgrid systems. Uncertainty around regulatory requirements can also discourage potential investors and stakeholders from participating in the microgrid market.
Recommendation:
DER and microgrid providers should work alongside utilities to develop policy recommendations and regulatory standards at the state and regional level. Having a unified position on key issues, such as interconnection standards, will allow DER and microgrid¬† providers to work more effectively with local authorities and utility providers to accelerate grid decarbonization, resilience and modernization.
Supply Chains
(Risk) ‚Äì
Supply chain constraints, like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, also pose a threat to Microgrids commercialization potential if critical components are not accessible.
Risk:
This is currently playing out today with a bottleneck for
switchgears
- an essential component to Microgrids (basically the nerve center). The majority of switchgear production comes out of China, whose supply chain is still recovering from disruptions. With incentives from the IRA, new switchgear production is being opened up in the U.S., which should help alleviate the current bottleneck over the next 1-3 years.
Execution R&O:
Project Implementation
(Risk) ‚Äì
Microgrid development projects are complex, with typical project timelines ranging anywhere from 1-5 years to complete. Risks related to the successful implementation of microgrid projects include: technical challenges, cost overruns, and delays, which can impact a company's ability to execute its strategy effectively.

(Risk and Opportunity) ‚Äì
Maintaining operational efficiency in the design, installation, and maintenance of microgrid systems is key to execution success. Inefficiencies or failures in operations can lead to increased costs and reduced customer satisfaction.
Partnerships and Alliances
(Opportunity) ‚Äì
The ability to form strategic partnerships with technology providers, utility companies, and other stakeholders can create opportunities for better market access, along with superior microgrids solutions offerings and project development capabilities.
Customer Acquisition
(Risk and Opportunity) ‚Äì
A company's ability to effectively market and sell its microgrid solutions to target customers is crucial for commercial success. These are long and complex deal cycles, where numerous stakeholders are involved, so the ability to effectively manage complexity and gain stakeholder alignment is essential to an effective customer acquisition strategy.
Risks
in this area include failing to understand customer needs or not effectively communicating the value proposition of microgrids.
Effective customer segmentation, targeting and management of the entire sales cycle (including project implementation) can create additional
opportunities
for microgrid operators.
Overall, a microgrid company's go-to-market strategy should carefully balance market and execution risks and opportunities to navigate the complex landscape of the microgrid industry successfully.
Customer Segmentation & Targeting
An important element to any Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy is customer segmentation and targeting, which starts with first defining your target customer archetype or ideal customer profile (ICP). In the case of Microgrid solutions providers, this can be approached by asking
‚ÄúWho values energy resilience the highest?‚Äù
and
‚ÄúWhat are the largest potential customer use cases?
In my experience, focusing on
driving penetration within a few key customer segments
and/or market niches can be an effective go-to-market approach, particularly in earlier stages of market development (i.e. microgrids).
By concentrating efforts on specific, targeted segments, microgrid integrators can tailor their solutions to meet the unique needs and challenges of those customers, thereby demonstrating clear value, building a strong reputation, establishing market positioning and setting a foundation for broader expansion in the future.
Go-To-Market Strategy Recommendation:¬† Focus on driving penetration within targeted customer segments and/or a market niche

Expanding additional clean energy tax incentives (like 45Q) to include smaller-scale DER solutions can help facilitate microgrid adoption. And finally, collaboration is needed amongst government, utilities and DER and microgrid operators to further develop policy frameworks around the market rules for microgrids
(The NREL provides a recommended policy framework for microgrids
here
).
Remaining Questions
:
Policy Evolution:
In the current U.S. regulatory scheme and market design shaped by and for centralized energy assets, how will policy evolve to help shape and accelerate the deployment and commercialization of DERs?
Role of Utilities:
And along those lines, what‚Äôs the role of utilities in this whole equation? Do they see the commercialization of microgrids as a direct threat to their business?
Customer Education and Engagement:
Microgrid commercialization & accessibility (via MAAS) is a fairly recent development‚Ä¶among the large pool of (potential) customers for microgrids, what is their level of awareness and understanding of these solutions?
Smart Controls Software:
Who is leading in this capability? Are more microgrid operators developing their own proprietary solutions in house or¬† outsourcing/partnering to technology/software providers?
Switchgear Bottleneck:
How soon will the switchgear supply chain bottlenecks get corrected? The current lead time for switchgears is 60-70 weeks out; when will this start to come down?
In conclusion, microgrids stand at the forefront of the clean energy transition, offering a dual solution for facilitating the clean energy transition and delivering energy resilience amidst the growing risks of adverse weather events. The convergence of recent advancements in policy, technology, and business models marks the onset of a pivotal decade for microgrid commercialization.
