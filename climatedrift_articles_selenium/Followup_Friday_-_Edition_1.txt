This month Wired went deep into the same issue: Upside Foods, a startup specializing in lab-grown meat, has been questioned for the transparency and viability of its production methods. The company claimed to produce lab-cultivated chicken fillets in their futuristic facility, depicting large bioreactors in its guided tours, giving an impression of mass production capabilities. However, WIRED’s investigation reveals a different story, indicating that Upside's flagship product is largely crafted by hand, in small quantities, using tiny bottles called roller bottles, a more labor-intensive and costly method not suitable for mass production.
