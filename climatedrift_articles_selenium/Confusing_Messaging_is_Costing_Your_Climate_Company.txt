Hi there! üëã
Marco here.
Today we feature a guest post by Alex, on a topic that resonates with so many people in climate: The lack of storytelling and good messaging in climate tech.

Let‚Äôs dive in üåä
Climate tech has a marketing problem.
Around the world, people are coming together to engage in the fight against climate change, launching countless startups with innovative solutions and cutting-edge tech‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶At the same time, many of them are severely struggling to communicate
what they actually do
.
From solar to ag tech, electrification to finance, climate organizations are as clear as mud when telling their story and communicating company value.
I‚Äôm a marketer with 7+ years of experience helping companies clarify their brand and product messaging. Over the past several months, I‚Äôve visited hundreds of climate tech websites and spent five to ten minutes browsing around trying to learn more about them. Nine times out of ten, I literally could not articulate what they do.
This is a problem, and it‚Äôs costing otherwise excellent companies potential customers, investors, press, and employees.
Example 1: Octopus Energy
Let‚Äôs take a look at the header section of Octopus Energy‚Äôs homepage:
While they do a nice job with a clear call to action, I have no idea what I‚Äôd be getting a quote
for
. The header text doesn‚Äôt really tell me anything, and while the awards are impressive, all they communicate is that Octopus Energy is good at‚Ä¶supplying energy?
My main rule for website messaging is that unless you‚Äôre an established global brand like Nike, Apple, or McDonalds, you need to assume that every visitor who comes to your site knows absolutely nothing about your company. It‚Äôs your job to clearly explain what you do within the first five to ten seconds of the homepage loading.
Example 2: Aurora Solar
We can also take a look at the hero section of Aurora Solar‚Äôs website. Instead of having one clear message about their product offering, they have a carousel with six slides and six offerings. The slides automatically scroll every five seconds, ensuring that nobody will have enough time to read and take action on any of them.
To be clear, I‚Äôm a fan of both Aurora Solar and Octopus Energy, but it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve put forth the effort to research them and understand the value they bring to the table. Most potential customers, investors, and employees aren‚Äôt going to do that.
The ‚Äúif we build it they will come‚Äù mindset doesn‚Äôt work. If people can‚Äôt quickly understand what you do, you‚Äôll be passed over in favor of better communicators. People don‚Äôt buy the best products ‚Äì they buy the products they can understand the fastest.
Climate tech and sustainability initiatives need to rapidly scale, both in marketplace adoption and size of the workforce. Better messaging can be the secret sauce to help make that happen.
How to Fix your Messaging
If you‚Äôre a founder or climate marketer reading this and thinking, ‚Äúbut what we do is complicated,‚Äù or, ‚Äúwe do several different things, so it‚Äôs hard to create a simple message,‚Äù I get it. It‚Äôs called the Curse of Knowledge, which occurs when you know so many details about your organization that it becomes difficult to imagine what it‚Äôs like not to know. I dealt with it for years as a startup cofounder.
But you need to dumb it down. Simplify and clarify your top-level messaging more than you think is necessary. You‚Äôll always have room to get into the details later.
Here are 3 key questions your brand messaging should answer. They can help you get started rethinking your pitch decks, website copy, and more.
What exactly are you offering?
Who‚Äôs it for?
How will it benefit them?
Here‚Äôs What Octopus and Aurora Solar Should Put on Their Homepages
I spent a few minutes in Photoshop reworking the header areas of Octopus Energy and Aurora Solar‚Äôs websites using this principle.
Here‚Äôs what I came up with:
Octopus Energy uses new technology and customer-friendly policies to eliminate the choice between green energy and low prices. Now their header shows potential customers that they can have their cake and eat it, too.
Aurora Solar knows that the process of selling residential and commercial solar can be complex. That‚Äôs why their product synthesizes every phase of the operation into one software platform that makes it much easier for solar installers to close deals with potential customers.
Once you begin to articulate the value your company creates, people will be able to mentally categorize you as a potentially useful entity in their lives. This will make it much easier for them to take the next step with your organization, whether that‚Äôs scheduling a demo, signing up for your email list, or applying for a job.
