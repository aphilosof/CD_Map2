Hey there,
Skander here.
We don‚Äôt often get the chance to dive as deep as we want into a topic.
But we are very happy that our drifters do.
Today, we are releasing a comprehensive 100-page guide on the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) space. It covers everything you need to know, from use cases to an overview of key players and the regulatory landscape.
For those who prefer a quicker read, we also prepared a brief 10-minute summary highlighting our highlights.
Let‚Äôs dive in üåä

Your Air Taxi Is Coming!
Advanced air mobility is about to change our lives. Imagine being able to book air taxis like ride shares, quietly fly above our crowded roadways, reduce travel times‚åöby up to 70%, and not pollute the atmosphere.
üöë Advanced air mobility will also save lives. Emergency care in rural areas will now be rapid ‚è±, arriving much faster than an ambulance and cheaper and quieter than a helicopterüöÅ ‚Äì and cleaner than both.
These are two example use cases where advanced air mobility will improve our lives. There are many others where affordable, quiet, clean air transportation brings enormous benefits.
So in this deep dive I will tackle some of the biggest current questions of Advanced Air Mobility, including:
Why should anybody care about advanced air mobility?
What are the use cases and leading companies?
What are the challenges and biggest benefits?
Will they be safe?
And now, time for some highlights:
Market Readiness and Economic Potential:
The AAM industry is on the verge of launching, with service introductions expected between 2024 and 2030. Significant investments and order backlogs from companies like Eve Air Mobility, Vertical Aerospace, Lilium, and Archer Aviation underscore the market's economic potential. For instance, Morgan Stanley projects a $1 trillion market by 2040, growing to $9 trillion by 2050‚Äã.
Environmental and Public Health Benefits:
AAM aircraft, primarily powered by electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, offer substantial environmental benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional hydrocarbon-based transportation. This shift is critical as transportation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, with aviation contributing 11% of the total. The transition to renewable energy sources for electricity generation further enhances these benefits.
Partnerships are expanding
Several advanced air mobility (AAM) aircraft manufacturers have formed strategic partnerships with major airlines, highlighting the integration of AAM into mainstream aviation. Notable collaborations include Archer with Etihad, IndiGo, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines; Joby with Delta Airlines; Lilium with Lufthansa and Saudia; and Vertical Aerospace with American Airlines. These partnerships aim to develop air taxi services for short distances and small passenger counts, potentially revolutionizing short-distance travel in a manner akin to the disruption caused by ride-sharing services. Additionally, specialized operators like Blade and Helijet are placing orders for eVTOL aircraft, and companies like Bristow Group are evaluating multiple AAM aircraft for specific markets such as offshore energy and government services. The commercial aspect of AAM involves significant financial investments and support from lessors and insurers, with various stakeholders providing the necessary capital and risk management to foster the industry's growth.
