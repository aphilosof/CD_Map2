Today we are looking at Food & Agriculture, from insect farms to plant based meat.
Let‚Äôs dive in üåä
First, as always, let‚Äôs look at the emissions of Food & Agriculture
From the great State of Climate Action 2022
Food and agriculture play vital roles in sustaining the global population, but they come with significant environmental implications. Collectively, these sectors account for about 24% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock alone contributes to nearly 14.5% of global emissions, with beef and dairy cattle being the primary culprits. Meanwhile, rice cultivation, responsible for around 10% of agricultural methane emissions, and deforestation, often pursued to create new farmlands, further exacerbate the problem. Additionally, about 70% of global freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture. As climate change becomes more pressing, reimagining these sectors to ensure sustainability while meeting global food demand is crucial.
Fortunately,  solutions are at hand: from alternative proteins like plant-based meats to efforts in curbing food waste. Let's explore the attendees of The Drop and delve into their solutions:
