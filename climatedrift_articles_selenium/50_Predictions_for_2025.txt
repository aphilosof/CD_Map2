Hey there ðŸ‘‹
Skander here.
When we published our
Climate Recap 2024
, we asked our community to share their predictions for 2025 and wow, did they deliver. Out of hundreds of messages & emails, weâ€™ve selected 50 of the most insightful.
This week, weâ€™ll break them down into three parts:
Part 1: Predictions from our community
: Drifties, startup founders, investors, and everyone in between. From RMI to Marble and Deep Science Ventures, from Circular Economy founders to reforestation experts.
Part 2: A deep dive into our solution sectors
, with two predictions per sector. Weâ€™ll also highlight which solution approaches are in and which are on their way out. This is based on dozens of calls over the last few weeks, aggregated and anonymized for you.
Part 3: The top climate predictions
from across the climate world. In this final part, weâ€™ve pulled together some of the best predictions published by our partner organizations.
