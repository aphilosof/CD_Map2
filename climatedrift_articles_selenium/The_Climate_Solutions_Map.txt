Hey everyone!
Skander here.
Many of you are aware that we've developed and adopted several frameworks for Climate Drift.
Our Climate Solution Map stands out as our crowning achievement to date.
Currently, our Climate Solution Map showcases over 220 solutions spanning 12 critical sectors: Transportation, Power, Food & Agriculture, Workforce, Building, Software, Finance, Circular Economy, Carbon Removal, Nature Conservation, and Water.
This is only a teaser, scroll to download the map.
WeÂ  have a specific threshold for solutions: they are past the idea stage (
TRL 3+
), are actively being worked on and have a chance to have a large possible impact on Climate Change and our race to Net Zero.
But here's the beauty - our map isn't set in stone. As we engage with experts, converse with investors, and collaborate with innovative companies, our map continually evolves.
To those who've shared their insights, you've been instrumental in shaping this tool â€“ a heartfelt thanks from us.
As always: If you have feedback, please send.
Letâ€™s dive in ðŸŒŠ

If you like Climate Driftâ€™s work and want to support you can of course always enter any amount and help us create more research (and buy DAC credits to offset the research and hosting costs so far - but this is a topic for another post).
This version is also ready to be printed as a poster - we plan to give them away at The Drop and other conferences. If you want one, write us under

.
Over the next months we plan to dive deep into each of the solutions areas, and share our perspectives on the current states & thesis for each.
We will also do special deep dives, like we just did for The Drop, Europeâ€™s largest climate tech conference:

For the rest of the week I will be attending the Drop, but donâ€™t worry: there will be great guest posts coming.
Stay tuned,
