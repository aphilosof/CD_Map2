Today we are looking at the
circular economy
: Rethink, Reduce, Recycle.
Let‚Äôs dive in üåä
The circular economy is a paradigm for production and consumption. Prioritizing sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling, it seeks to maximize the longevity and usefulness of materials and products.
It is based on three foundational principles:
Rethink
involves leveraging low-carbon and carbon-negative materials, aiming for a greener product inception. By 2030, this could lead to a 48% reduction in Europe's CO2 emissions compared to 2012 levels.
Reduce
emphasizes re-using and returning packaging. In line with this, the European Commission predicted a 10% waste reduction by 2030.
Recycle
focuses on efficiently mapping and managing discarded materials and using advanced recycling technologies. With a comprehensive approach, material savings in sectors like electronics could reach $1 trillion annually by 2025.
Let‚Äôs see which solutions along the value chain the companies at the Drop are exploring:
Pentatonic
Pentatonic offers a tech-empowered platform to streamline the journey towards circularity. Their unique Material Lifecycle Management (MLM) system provides an integrated solution for companies to source, track, and recycle materials across their products. Serving as a central hub, it connects suppliers, recyclers, and stakeholders, backed by high-touch engineering to navigate challenges.
By 2030, they aim to manage over 1 million tons of materials annually. Collaborating with Fortune 500 companies like Starbucks, Nike, Microsoft, and L'Oreal, and with offices in Berlin, London, and New York, Pentatonic provides end-to-end solutions. These encompass product design, supply chain optimizations, and customer engagement strategies to promote closed-loop consumption.

one ‚Ä¢ fƒ±ve
Founded in 2020, Hamburg-based startup One Point Five, named after the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree global warming target, recently secured ‚Ç¨10.5 million for their innovative "litter-proof" packaging solutions. If discarded, their materials degrade naturally without harming ecosystems. Leveraging a unique software, they scan global patents, particularly from universities, licensing or purchasing relevant IP. They then tailor and build these technologies for specific packaging needs, developing prototypes onsite. With a current focus on Asia, One Point Five aims to expand across Europe, starting with Germany.

Epoch Biodesign
A Short note on Plastic:
Addressing the critical challenge of plastic waste is paramount. Every year, a staggering 460 million tonnes of plastic is produced, with recycling efforts falling short. Furthermore, plastic production contributes up to 2Gt of CO2 emissions annually. Despite its vital role in multiple applications, the majority of plastics, due to inadequate waste management, are either incinerated, dumped in landfills, or find their way into our oceans.
Epoch tackles this challenge through a combination of computational and experimental techniques: They are developing enzymes that can transform plastics into low-carbon, circular chemicals. They envision a world where plastic waste isn't merely thrown away ‚Äî it's repurposed into environmentally-friendly and valuable commodities.

Swedish Algae Factory
Swedish Algae Factory specializes in cultivating diatoms, a group of algae, and extracting their silica shells for diverse applications, termed Algica. While primarily utilized in cosmetics, studies suggest that Algica might boost silicon solar panel efficiency by 4% and DSSC by 38%. According to WWF, each kilogram of Algica¬Æ in solar panels could potentially reduce CO2 emissions by around 200 tons. The production leverages a circular methodology, using nutrient-rich water from land-based fish farms. In this process, the algae consume CO2 and vital nutrients, aiding the development of sustainable fish feed.

Intropic Materials
Intropic Materials is working on enzyme stabilizing technology, embedding degrading enzymes in plastics to ensure a responsible end-of-life from the outset. Once activated, these enzymes cause the plastic to quickly degrade into biodegradable or chemically recyclable molecules. Enzymes, with their vast functional diversity, hold promise for revolutionizing sectors from sustainable materials to food technology and pharmaceuticals. Yet, their stability outside of cells has hindered broad application. Intropic Materials offers a scalable solution to this, aiming for a sustainable, circular bio-based economy and a forefront in compostable plastics.
