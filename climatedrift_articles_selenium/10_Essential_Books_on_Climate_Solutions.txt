State of Climate Action 2022
TLDR: This report guides the allocation of 10 billion USD by the Bezos Earth Fund, outlining priorities and investment areas.
The "State of Climate Action 2022" report is a collaborative effort by various organizations, including the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Action Tracker, Climate Analytics, the United Nations High-Level Climate Change Champions, and the World Resources Institute.
The report provides a comprehensive assessment of the global gap in climate action, highlighting the progress and areas where acceleration is needed. It assesses 40 indicators of systems change and finds that none are on track to reach their 2030 targets. While some indicators show promising progress, others are well below the required pace, and some are even heading in the wrong direction.
