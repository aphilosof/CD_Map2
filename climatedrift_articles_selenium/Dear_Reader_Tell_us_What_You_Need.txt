==============================

Hey you,
Marco here ðŸ‘‹
Today something different: A survey.
Iâ€™m not a big fan of surveys either.
Heck, my first job out of school was creating, designing, and analyzing survey data.
So you can imagine how much I was against doing this.
But everyone told me:
Talk to your readers.
So here we are.
Please fill out this 5-minute survey.
This is your chance to tell us what you need.
Then we go to work and make it happen.
It will help us:
Figure out the content and products we should create to help people start a career in climate.
Understand what you need more ofâ€¦sub-sectors deep dive, career advice, interviews with founders, company profiles, job highlights,... something we never even thought about.
Here is the link to the survey:

Thank you in advance for helping us out ðŸ™Œ
Stay awesome!
Aloha,
Marco & Skander
