Hey, Skander here! Welcome to the first
Climate Drift

Looking back on 2023
Climate Drift began with a simple idea. In a conversation with non-climate friends, I shared my theses and research spanning the past two years. Their suggestion? Publish it.
So, together with Marco, we gathered, wrote, and published. Every day for 2 months, we dove deep into climate solutions, 5 to 15-page essays on anything from
hydrogen
to
transportation
, and
mushrooms
.
Climate Drift‚Äôs reception was way over our modest expectations.
Our readership now spans the 3 audiences of the climate world:
Climate investors, from small climate angels to large sovereign wealth funds
Companies, from Fortune companies wanting to be greener to climate tech companies working on solutions
People who want to join the fight and shift to climate.
So we got to work:
Helping climate investors & companies:
We talked to dozens of investors and companies, seeing where we could help, leading to some interesting internal projects and some even more interesting soon-to-be-coming public projects.

Helping climate job seekers:
We opened up our calendars for 1on1 climate career mentor calls, talking to hundreds of you, and spending 100+ hours helping people find their perfect climate role.
We just opened up a new batch of 1on1 climate career mentor slots, you can apply here:

As we couldn‚Äôt go through the full waitlist of 350+ 1on1 mentor calls, we
ran our first 3-hour-long climate career transition workshop
with a few hundred of you. In case you missed it, the 2nd one is planned for the end of this month.

So what‚Äôs coming in 2024?
In 2024, we're diving deeper.
üî¨ Collaborating with investors & established companies, we're launching public research projects that should benefit the whole industry.
‚òÄÔ∏è We will feature more climate companies, explaining and highlighting their solutions.
üöÄ Last but not least: we're starting the
Climate Drift Career Accelerator
, helping a group of our readers into their dream climate roles, accelerating the climate transition.
We will have more to share about all of them, but for now let‚Äôs shine a light on the Climate Drift Career Accelerator:
The Climate Drift Career Accelerator is an 8-week program for mid-career and exec level climate job seekers.
We are going to cover:
