Today we are looking at Industry, from carbon free cement to green hydrogen.
Let‚Äôs dive in üåä
Let‚Äôs first dive into the industry emissions
From the always great State of Climate Action
Industry stands as a cornerstone of modern civilization, fueling economies and producing essential commodities. However, with progress comes cost: as of 2019, industries contributed to approximately 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with energy production leading the chart. Particularly, the burning of fossil fuels in the industrial sector alone released over 6 billion tonnes of CO2 annually.
Thankfully we have solutions: from less carbon intensive concrete to new chemical processes, let‚Äôs discover who is attending The Drop and what they are working on:
Glencore
